# Earth-curvature-calculator Legacy
Terminal based Python program for calculating the curvature of the Earth.

This is the legacy version of the calculator. Not much is different about the legacy version from the latest version except that the legacy version does not support Python 3.

PLEASE NOTE: This calculator does not take into account altitude, it only calculates the curvature of the Earth at a given distance. This is, however, more accurate than the "8 inches per mile squared" formula!

# Instructions

## For kilometers
`python path-to-main.py KM distance-in-kilometers`

## For miles
`python path-to-main.py MI distance-in-miles`

## Example command
`python main.py KM 1`

## Requirements
Python 2.7
