# Earth-curvature-calculator
Terminal based Python program for calculating the curvature of the Earth.

If you want to use Python 2, use the legacy version in the legacy branch. The latest version of this calculator only supports Python 3.

PLEASE NOTE: This calculator does not take into account altitude, it only calculates the curvature of the Earth at a given distance. This is, however, more accurate than the "8 inches per mile squared" formula!

# Instructions

## For kilometers
`py path-to-main.py KM distance-in-kilometers`

## For miles
`py path-to-main.py MI distance-in-miles`

## Example command
`py main.py KM 1`

## Requirements
Python 3.7
