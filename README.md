# Earth-curvature-calculator
Terminal based Python program for calculating the curvature of the Earth.

PLEASE NOTE: This calculator does not take into account altitude, it only calculates the curvature of the Earth at a given distance. This is, however, more accurate than the "8 inches per mile squared" formula!

# Instructions

## For kilometers
`python path-to-main.py KM distance-in-kilometers`

## For miles
`python path-to-main.py MI distance-in-miles`

## Example command
`python main.py KM 1`

## Requirements
Python 2.7
