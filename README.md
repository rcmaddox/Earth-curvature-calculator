# Earth-curvature-calculator
Terminal based Python program for calculating the curvature of the Earth.

PLEASE NOTE: This calculator is not useful for anything beyond minor practicalities, it uses the classic "8 inches per mile squared" formula to reach it's conclusion, which that in itself is an approximation. The calculator also doesn't take into account altitude for any of it's calculations, so just keep this in mind!

# Instructions

## For kilometers
`python path-to-main.py KM distance-in-kilometers`

## For miles
`python path-to-main.py MI distance-in-miles`

## Example command
`python main.py KM 1`

## Requirements
Python 2.7
